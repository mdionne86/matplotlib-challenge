# matplotlib-challenge

### This assignment was completed using a few differnt methodolgies I found around online to optimize the code.

### The Bar Plot instructions indicate we need to see the number of mice per timepoint per drug.
###  I decided a stacked bar made the most sense to accomplish this request. This was signficantly easier to accomplish using pandas.DataFrame.plot vs pyplot, as you will see it takes much less code.
###
###  There may be an easier way to do stacked bars in pyplot, but everything I found indicated you needed to plot each stack separately.
###
###  For the Bar Plots, I would suggest you come up with something else to plot, as what the TA indicated is actually desired from this makes no sense from an analytical standpoint. I actually work in the pharmaceutical industry, and we look at this type of data using line plots:

###  The rest of the assignment was much more straightforward!
